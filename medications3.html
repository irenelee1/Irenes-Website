    <h2>Medication and Treatments for the diabetes</h2>
    <p>As I told in the diabetes they have 3 type of tratments and medication, Treatment for type 1 diabetes always involves insulin. People can self-inject insulin under the skin, or, if hospitalized, a doctor might inject insulin directly into the blood.</p>
    <p>There are several different types of insulin:</p>
    <p>Rapid-acting injections take effect within 5 to 15 minutes but last for a shorter time of 2 to 4 hours:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>insulin lispro (Humalog)</li>
      <li>insulin aspart (NovoLog)</li>
      <li>insulin glulisine (Apidra)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Short-acting injections take effect from between 30 minutes and 1 hour, and last for 3 to 8 hours:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>regular insulin (Humulin R and Novolin R)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Long-acting injections take effect after 1 or 2 hours and last for between 14 and 24 hours:</p>
<ul>
